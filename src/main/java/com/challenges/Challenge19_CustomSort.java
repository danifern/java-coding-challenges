     * CHALLENGE 19 (Part A): Bubble Sort

     * Implement the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the given array in place.
     * Bubble sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements,
     * and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
     * <p>
     * Example:
     * - [6, 5, 2, 1, 9, 10, 0] -> [0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10]
     *
     * @param array The input array to be sorted.

     * Implement the Selection Sort algorithm to sort the given array in place.
     * Selection sort divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist
     * and an unsorted sublist. It repeatedly finds the minimum element from
     * the unsorted sublist and moves it to the sorted sublist.
     *
     * @param array The input array to be sorted.
