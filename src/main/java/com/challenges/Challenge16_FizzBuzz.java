     * CHALLENGE 16: FizzBuzz
     * <p>
     * Instructions:
     * Write a method that accepts an integer and returns a String based on the following rules:
     * - If the number is divisible by 3, return "Fizz".
     * - If the number is divisible by 5, return "Buzz".
     * - If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, return "FizzBuzz".
     * - Otherwise, return the number as a String.
     * <p>
     * The larger problem is to print the results for numbers from 1 to 100,
     * but for testing purposes, we will focus on the logic for a single number.
     * <p>
     * Examples:
     * - 3 -> "Fizz"
     * - 5 -> "Buzz"
     * - 15 -> "FizzBuzz"
     * - 4 -> "4"
     *
     * @param number The input integer.
     * @return A string corresponding to the FizzBuzz rules.
