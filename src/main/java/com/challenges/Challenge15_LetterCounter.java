     * CHALLENGE 15: Count Letter Appearances
     * <p>
     * Instructions:
     * Write a method that accepts a string as an argument. The method should
     * count the number of appearances of each character and return a Map.
     * The key will be a character and the value will be the number of times
     * it appeared in the string.
     * <p>
     * Examples:
     * - countLetters("hello") -> {h=1, e=1, l=2, o=1}
     * - countLetters("aaaaaa") -> {a=6}
     * - countLetters("abc") -> {a=1, b=1, c=1}
     *
     * @param str The input string.
     * @return A Map with characters as keys and their counts as values.
